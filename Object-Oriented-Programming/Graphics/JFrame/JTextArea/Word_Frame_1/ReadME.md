# Java_21_Words_Frame_1

With the output text in a textarea the focus is on building a long string to be fed to the JTextArea constructor. 

In **Words.java** (another Repo) each line is created by using *System.out.println()*. 

In **WordsFrame.java** we have a textarea containing a single string s with all lines of output: 

To build s  we have to concatenate each output line with         *s += output line* 

Each output line should contain the special character “*\n*”   (i.e. go to the next line).
