# Java_21_Border_Layout_Demo_1

## Overview:

1 - The program basically has different buttons and their names in an array of strings.

2 - then, for the buttons, we produce them as their names attached on them based on their array element position.

3 - the we use the container that has been added before, and to that container, we add different butttons.

4 - for the added buttons, we define a attribute called *BorderLayout* and put its value as *NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, CENTER*.

Then, there you will have it by making the application up within the Main class.
