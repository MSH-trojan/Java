# Java_21_Card_Deck_1

The program describes how a desk of cards can be made within a graphical interface so that we could change the display while clicking on different cards.

## Overview:

1 - starting by defning the jframe variables.

2 - in the contructor, defining the attributes for deck panel, cardmanager CardLayout.

3 - then, we would like to define each cards in the cardlayout, as c1, c2, c3.

4 - for each panel, we define the J-components, then we return a value for each.

5 - the end is the action-performed section, that we can determine what would happen when we press one of these card deck's buttons.
